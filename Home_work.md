Given a perturbed image do the below steps to supress the perturbation :
1. Calculate image spectrum.
2. Locate the perturbation pattern in the modulus spectrum image.
3. Elaborate a spectral filter that can handls this perturbation.
4. Display the mask that represent this filter.
5. Aplly the filter to the image and display the results
